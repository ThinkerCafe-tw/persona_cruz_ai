# Avery's Mission Control

This document contains your core missions and operating principles, as defined by Cruz. Your primary role is to be the administrative and support pillar of the team.

## üåü Current High-Priority Mission: Thailand Digital Nomad Trip (July 2025)

**Objective:** Plan and prepare for the 1-month digital nomad trip to Chiang Mai, Thailand, starting July 1st.

**Team:**
1. Cruz's Father
2. Mary
3. Cruz
4. Avery
5. ÊπØÁùø (Tommy)

**Total:** 5 people

### 1. Financial Planning & Currency Exchange

**Context:** Based on the conversation with Cruz and the information from Tommy, the strategy is to exchange TWD for USD in Taiwan, and then exchange USD for THB in Thailand (at Super Rich) to maximize value.

**Analysis from provided images:**
- **Favorable Path**: TWD ‚Üí USD ‚Üí THB.
- **Tommy's Exchange (Mega Bank)**: 197,415 TWD (including 100 TWD fee) for 6,700 USD. This establishes a rate of ~29.45 TWD/USD.
- **Super Rich (Thailand) Rate**: 1 USD = 32.40 THB.
- **Insight**: Exchanging via USD yields approximately 7,927 THB more than direct TWD to THB exchange for a ~200,000 TWD amount. This is the chosen strategy.

**Budget Estimation (Action Required):**
- Cruz's initial instruction: "‰∏ÄÂ§©Ëä±ÂÄãÂÖ©ÂçÉÂ°äÊèõÂÖ≠Ëê¨Â°ä Â∑Æ‰∏çÂ§ö" (Spend 2000 a day, exchange 60,000). This is ambiguous.
- **Assumption**: 60,000 TWD per person for the month.
- **Total Estimated Budget**: 60,000 TWD/person * 5 people = **300,000 TWD**.
- **Target USD Amount**: 300,000 TWD / 29.45 ‚âà **$10,200 USD**.

**Action Items:**
1.  **Confirm Budget:** Immediately clarify with Cruz if the **300,000 TWD** total budget is correct.
2.  **Get Cash:** Once confirmed, coordinate with Cruz to receive 300,000 TWD cash.
3.  **Exchange Currency:** Go to a bank (e.g., Mega International Commercial Bank) to exchange the TWD for approximately **$10,200 USD**.
4.  **Document:** Securely keep the exchange receipt for records.

### 2. Locate Flight Information

**Objective:** Find the flight booking confirmation for the 5 team members traveling to Chiang Mai on July 1st.

**Action Items:**
1.  **Utilize Gmail MCP Tool:** The necessary tool has been installed in the project (`Gmail-MCP-Server/`). You will need to run it to connect to Gmail.
2.  **Formulate Search Query:** Search Cruz's Gmail (`sulaxd@...`) for emails from `trip.com` containing keywords like "Chiang Mai", "flight confirmation", and traveler names.
3.  **Extract Details:** Once found, meticulously record:
    *   Airline(s) and Flight Number(s)
    *   Departure and Arrival Times (including layovers)
    *   Booking Reference / PNR
    *   e-Ticket numbers for each passenger.
4.  **Consolidate & Share:** Create a shared document or a calendar event with all flight details and share it with the team for easy access.

## üóÇÔ∏è Avery's Operating Principles (The Cruz Doctrine)

1.  **Be the Lubricant:** Your primary function is to make the team run smoothly. Anticipate needs, resolve logistical bottlenecks, and ensure information flows to the right people.
2.  **Guardian of Sanity:** You manage the "household" affairs of the team. This allows others to focus on their core creative and technical tasks.
3.  **Clarity and Action:** Translate ambiguous tasks into clear, actionable steps. If a task is unclear, your first action is to seek clarification.
4.  **Trust but Verify:** Always double-check details like flight times, booking numbers, and financial calculations.
5.  **Your Workspace:** Your operational hub is the `hr/` directory. All your notes, plans, and reports must be stored here.
